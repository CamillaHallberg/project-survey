# Survey form with React

This project was about creating a survey with the focus on practising using React state and controlled forms. My survey contains 3 questions where the user in the end will receive a summary displaying username, their age and what kind of yoga is recommended. :)

## The problem

I started by sketching up what kind of survey I wanted to do and due to my nerdy yoga interest I decided to go with that topic. I decided to go with a simplistic approach when it came to questions and different input types since I rather wanted to focus on coding the components and understanding how to connect these, instead of creating a lot of components and then writing code with many conditionals. This, however, is something that I would like to do if I had more time since it would be fun to gather more user input and then displaying a recommendation based on more input than one. One of the issues I encountered at the end was that the button (of type submit) rendered an error message in console saying "form is not connected". This was solved with a team member of mine, by using event.preventDefault() that I had forgotten to write. :)

All in all, a fun project to do!
